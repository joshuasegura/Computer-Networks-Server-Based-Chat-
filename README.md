# Computer Networks Server Based Chat
Implemented chat history into the project. The code around it is rough but it works I just need to clean the code up nbd though. I you have to link the .jar file in order to compile the Server.java now though because I used an external json 
library. I might change up the library to googles version(gson) simply because you can format the .json file with that so that it is readable.  -- JS

The TCP chat works now(log in, log out, chat). It can do multiple chats as well. Need to implement the chat history portion
    -- JS

I updated UDPClient.java and UDPServer.java and now the UDP authentication is done. Encryption done. TCP chat startup also done, this includes initiation and the actual chatting between clients. -- JS
