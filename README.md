# Computer Networks Server Based Chat
I updated UDPClient.java and UDPServer.java so the UDP portion is pretty much done. Just need to do some minor tweaking
to check if a user is valid or not and need to create the encrypted channel once AUTH_SUCCES is passed. To compile the files
in the command line javac UDPClient.java and javac UDPServer.java. And like before to run you'll need two command line windows
and make sure you run java UDPServer before java UDPClient. If you have any questions about the code let me know I didn't 
comment it the way that I should have.   -- JS
