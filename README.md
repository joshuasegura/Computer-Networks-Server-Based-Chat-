# Computer Networks Server Based Chat
I updated UDPClient.java and UDPServer.java and now the UDP authentication is done. Encryption done. TCP chat startup also done, this includes initiation and the actual chatting between clients. -- JS

The TCP chat works now(log in, log out, chat). It can do multiple chats until a client logs out. Has something to do with 
the ecryption key from shifting the arraylists when a user logs out.  -- JS
